<h1><center>Continuous Real-World Representative Benchmark Optimization Problem Repository</center></h1>

<h2>About</h2>

<p>This is a repository for optimization problems.  The aim is to provide a resource that collects, documents and specifies a set of optimization problems to facilitate the evaluation and comparison of optimization algorithms.  To support this and encourage high standards of experimental research, wherever possible, datasets, references, source code and results obtained will also be collected.
</p>

<h2>Problem Specification</h2>

<p>Problems are organised into categories and instances within each category.  Each problem instance is uniquely identified with a tuple:<br><br>
<code>&lt;category,instance,feasible region,dimensionality&gt;</code>
</p>

<h2>Problem Categories</h2>
